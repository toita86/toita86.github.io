# Hey, I’m Eduard

I’m a curious developer with a background in **mechanics and mechatronics**, now exploring the world of **computer science, algorithms, and creative software**.  
These days, I’m studying for my **MSc in Computer Science at Aalborg University**, where I get to work on projects that blend **data, different programming paradigms, control systems, and human computer interactions**.

Before all this, I spent time tinkering with industrial robots, working on automation systems, and later dove into **software engineering** working with ERP frameworks like Odoo and Frappe working with companies and their needs.  
Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with writing code that helps *other* developers build better tools, automate processes and improve the development environments.

### What This Blog Is About

This space is my learning log.  
You’ll find:
- Notes from my **“learn with me” series** (currently exploring the **JUCE framework**, so keep up eye on the posts if you are interested)
- Thoughts on programming, AI, and my attempts of figuring things out
- Occasional deep dives into tools or ideas that I find interesting

It’s not meant to be a tutorial site — more like a record of the things that I’m learning and how i got there.

### Things I Like to Build With

I move between a few stacks depending on the project:
- **Languages:** Python, C++, Haskell, Dart  
- **Frameworks:** JUCE, Flutter, Odoo, Django, Node.js  
- **Tools:** Docker, Git, SLURM, Ollama  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL  

Mostly, I enjoy understanding *why* things work, not just *how*.

### What I’m Working On

Lately, I’ve been learning **JUCE**, a C++ framework for building audio applications.  
It’s been challenging, but that’s exactly why I’m documenting it here — I believe that explaining what you learn is the best way to really learn it.

### Let’s Connect

If you ever want to chat about tech, learning, open-source projects, or for telling me that I have done something wrong, I’m always up for a good conversation.
